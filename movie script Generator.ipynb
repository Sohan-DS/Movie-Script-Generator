      "Opening shot of the Amazon jungle with the sounds of birds and insects chirping in the background. A group of archaeologists led by Dr. Erica Rivers is walking through the dense forest, searching for a lost treasure that has been rumored to be hidden deep in the jungle for centuries.\n",

      "The group starts running towards the exit, dodging falling rocks and debris. Just as they think they won't make it, they burst through the exit and run towards the river. As they look back, they see the temple collapse into the jungle, burying the lost treasure of the Amazon forever.\n",
